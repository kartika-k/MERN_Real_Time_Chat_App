# MERN_Real_Time_Chat_App-CatchUP 

A full-stack real-time chat application built using the MERN stack with WebSocket support for real-time communication. This application offers seamless one-on-one private chats, room-based group messaging, and user-friendly features like light/dark mode and responsive design.

# Overview
This application supports:

- Private Chats: Chat with other users privately in a secure environment.

- Room Chats: Create rooms to facilitate group discussions.

- Real-Time Updates: User status changes, message notifications, and room events are all updated instantly.

- Responsive UI: Works perfectly on all devices, supporting both light and dark modes.

# Technologies
- database - MongoDB
- backend - Express.js & Node.js
- frontend - React.js (with styled-components)
- Real-time messages - Socket.io

# Architecture

Application Structure
The project is structured into two main directories:

# Client:

- Built with React.js.

- Handles UI and user interactions.

Communicates with the backend via REST APIs and WebSockets.

# Server:

- Built with Node.js and Express.js.

- Manages business logic, authentication, and database interactions.

- Uses Socket.io to enable real-time communication.

# Concurrency Handling

- Socket.io: Ensures real-time updates using WebSocket connections.

- Manages simultaneous user connections efficiently.

- Broadcasts events such as user status changes and room updates to relevant clients only.

- MongoDB: Handles concurrent database operations, like storing chat history and user data, with built-in ACID compliance.
- Design Choices:
- Stateless REST APIs are combined with persistent WebSocket connections for optimal real-time communication.
- Scalable event-handling architecture ensures minimal latency during high traffic.

  # Assumptions and Design Choices
- Assumptions
- Users must sign in to access chat features.
- A user can participate in multiple chat rooms simultaneously.
- Messages are delivered only to online users in real-time. Offline users can view missed messages after logging in.
- Design Choices
- Authentication:
- Used JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and stateless user sessions.
- JWT tokens expire periodically to enhance security.
- Themes and RWD:
- Chose styled-components for dynamic theme switching.
- Ensured responsive web design (RWD) for mobile-first usability.
- Real-Time Communication:
- Leveraged Socket.io for its robust event-driven model.
- Implemented event broadcasting for room-based communication.

  # Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or above) – Download here
- MongoDB – Download here
